# Week 1, Day 1

*We set out to find something to hold,  
When seeking truth the answer is the road,  
When seeking wisdom the journey is your home,  
Fight through the wind,  
Fight through the rain,  
Fight through the cold*  

*We left ourselves behind on dancing wire,  
The loved ones we left back home will be our choir,  
Let the doubters be the stick, the thorn, the brier,  
Fight through the wind,  
Fight through the rain,  
Dance in the fire*  

*Don't bless me,  
No, don't bless me,  
We don't want your blessings,  
Don't bless me,  
We don't want your blessings*  

*Give me the pen,  
Give me the sword,  
Let me cut away the darkness, and pin it to the wall,  
Let us sing a song of beauty as before,  
Give us the wind,  
Give us the wind,  
Give us the storm*  

*Pushing back the lake,  
We found something more,  
Like a song in a word,  
Like the heartbreak of birds*  

*And there, beneath the sand,  
Looking like the rain,  
We found some God,  
And the will to change*  

*We set out to find something to hold,  
When seeking truth the answer is the road,  
When seeking wisdom the journey is your home,  
Fight through the wind,  
Fight through the rain,  
Fight through the cold*  

*Give me the pen,  
Give me the sword,  
Let me cut away the darkness, and pin it to the wall,  
Let us sing a song of beauty as before,  
Give us the wind,  
Give us the wind,  
Give us the storm*
